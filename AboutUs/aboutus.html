        I also welcome u to join our membership for one year. Our service is one year renew one time.
        For our original intention is store the important memories to avoid we forgot it.
        For our life , we need some appreciate people, some memorable memory , our website's service
        is for the people want store their memory like the coffer but ours one is store memory not the money or
        important thing.
        Some people thing memory is not that much important but most of the people thing memory is the memorable so
        their dont want to forget the memory but brain is limit , it can memorize too many thing so that I create
        this website for me to memorize all the important memory. If u are insterested, also can contact us or email us.
        <span class="abus">WELCOME!!!</span>
        <br /><br />
        For the Review Memory part, Some people think so complicated to write down, memorize back the memory,
        they just have the photos like they go travel around the world, a day of memorable and so on. Afterward,
        thsy can make a video or we can can take some time help the client make the video but the client need provided
        the
        information , photos and videos. These also is one of the idea to store our memories. If u want store the
        memory,
        have many solutions to store it but what i think is these ideas. If u have another idea, also can
        email or contact us.
